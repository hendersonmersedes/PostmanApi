# PostmanApi
Greetings! I'm learning a lot about API integration and testing APIs so I decided to take a Udemy course focused specifically on using Postman API.
I wanted to add in a few examples of code that is used to test, along with screenshots
The documentation used is from a Simple Tool Rental API: https://github.com/vdespa/quick-introduction-to-postman/blob/main/simple-tool-rental-api.md
